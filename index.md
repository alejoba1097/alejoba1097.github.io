Machine Learning Engineer based in Medellín with **5+ years of experience** in Python, data analysis, and machine learning. I specialize in generative AI, computer vision, OCR, document understanding, and turning messy data into production-ready ML systems.

Currently working on end-to-end ML solutions: from model training and evaluation to deploying optimized models on cloud (AWS, Azure) and edge/mobile devices (Jetson, ONNX Runtime, Flutter). I also build data pipelines, warehouses, and analytics layers that deliver real value to stakeholders.

## Tech Stack

Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Spark, SQL, ONNX, AWS (S3, Lambda, Glue, SageMaker, Redshift), Kubernetes, Power BI.
