Machine Learning Engineer based in Medellín with **5+ years of experience** in Python, data analysis, and machine learning. I specialize in computer vision, OCR, document understanding, and turning messy data into production-ready ML systems.

I work end-to-end on ML projects: from data collection and labeling, through model training and evaluation, to deploying optimized models on cloud (AWS, Azure) and edge/mobile devices (Jetson Orin/Nano, ONNX Runtime, Flutter). My recent work includes building 3D point cloud workflows with Open3D and depth cameras for dimension estimation, as well as implementing RAG systems and working with LLMs.

Beyond ML, I design and ship data solutions: building pipelines (Spark, Python), data warehouses (Redshift, RDS), and analytics layers (Power BI, Qlik Sense) that actually get used by stakeholders. Before moving fully into data and ML, I led operations teams—so I'm comfortable owning KPIs, talking to non-technical stakeholders, and translating business problems into technical work.

My background is an MSc in Data Science and Analytics plus a BSc in Process Engineering. I hold AWS Certified AI Practitioner and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications, and I'm actively leveling up in MLOps and Generative AI to keep pushing toward a technical lead role in ML/AI teams.
