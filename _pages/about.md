Machine Learning Engineer and Process Engineer based in Medellín, with a strong focus on computer vision, OCR, and turning messy data into production-ready ML systems. Over the last few years I've worked end-to-end: from data collection and labeling, through model training and evaluation, to deploying models on cloud and edge/mobile devices.

Right now I design and ship ML and data solutions across AWS and Azure: building pipelines (Spark, Python), data warehouses (Redshift, RDS), and analytics layers (Power BI, Qlik Sense) that actually get used by stakeholders. Before moving fully into data and ML, I led operations teams, so I'm very comfortable owning KPIs, talking to non-technical stakeholders, and translating business problems into technical work.

My background is an MSc in Data Science and Analytics plus a BSc in Process Engineering, and I'm actively leveling up in MLOps and Generative AI to keep pushing toward a technical lead role in ML/AI teams.
